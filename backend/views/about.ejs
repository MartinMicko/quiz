        <h2>Who Are We?</h2>
        <p>We’re just two friends — part developers, part explorers — who wanted to add a little joy, randomness, and surprise to the internet.
          Whether it’s a funny image, a thoughtful quote, or something absurdly unexpected, we love building weirdly delightful things.</p>

    <h2>What Is This Project?</h2>
    <p>"What's in the Box?" is a digital mystery experience. Every day, you can open a new box — just one — and find something different.
      Maybe it's funny. Maybe it's rare. Maybe it's nonsense. But that’s the magic. It’s our small reminder to stay curious, take a moment, and embrace the unexpected.</p>
